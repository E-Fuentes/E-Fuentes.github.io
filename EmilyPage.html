  The issue of the pay wage has been around since women started entering the
  workforce in large numbers around the sixties. In order to fix this issue,
  they passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963. This was aimed to abolish the
  inequality in pay between sexes. After passing such law, men and women were
  paid equally, right? Wrong. While signing the act did cause the gap to
  dwindle, it’s still very much around. Women make roughly 80 cents per the
  men's dollar and even less when broken up by race. Women of color tend to make
  on average 58 cents to every man’s dollar, Black women making roughly 62 and
  Hispanics making around 54 and indiginous Women are around the middle at 57
  cents per dollar according to the census. While discriminating based on gender
  and race is now illegal, pay gaps also stem from stereotypes in the workforce.
  “Women jobs” or jobs predominantly held by women tend to get paid less on
  average and have less benefits. Reasons why women were paid less in the past
  include working less hours due to at home unpaid duties, "less work
  experience" due to leaves caused by child care, and down right discrimination.
  While a few cents an hour may not seem like much, but can leave a large gap in yearly earnings.
