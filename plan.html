    <h2>
      Emily's Plan
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the fight for gender equality continues, I hope to bring awareness
      to the difference in pay wages. As the generation of the future, I want
      everyone to equal on every level, especially financially. With the help of
      statistics and studys, my goal is to educate the generations to come with
      hopes that when they're in office they can abolish this issue.

      Jornya's Plan
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you start to educate yourself, you realize stereotypes make no form
      of sense, specifically in fashion. I am here to bring awareness of the
      stupidity and unfairness around these stereotypes. Men and women should be
      able to dress as they so desire.
